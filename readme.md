# Pong.js
### by K. Daniel Adams

This is pong for typescript.  It's a bit more regimented than other JS syntaxes, and particularly well-suited to handle OOP conventions.

## Usage
1. Clone the project.
```
> git clone git@github.com:kdanieladams/pong.js.git
> cd ./pong.js
```
2. Install project dependencies (Typescript and Webpack).
```
> npm install
```
3. Build and run the project.
```
npm run build && npm start
```
4. Visit the appropriate url in the browser (defaults to http://localhost:3000).
