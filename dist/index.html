        <h1>Pong.js</h1>
        <p>
            This is pong in typescript.  There is a crude AI implemented at the moment, which I 
            will likely revise later.  The right-side paddle is controlled with the up-arrow and 
            down-arrow.  Press spacebar to start the game.  I did not reference any other projects
            or guides to get this far, although I may need a reference for the finer points of
            pong (e.g. angular trajectory from a moving paddle, an AI which offers a decent challenge
            instead of just following the ball perfectly, drawing the score using squares so it 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong" target="_blank">looks like it did on the old arcade cabinet</a>, etc.).
